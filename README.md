Gemini LLM Application

Purpose: The Gemini LLM Application is a conversational AI demo built using Streamlit and Google's Generative AI (Gemini) model. The application allows users to interact with the Gemini model by asking questions and receiving responses in a chat-like interface. The purpose of this application is to demonstrate the capabilities of the Gemini model in understanding and responding to user queries, and to provide a simple and intuitive interface for users to engage with the model.

Features:
          Chat History: The application maintains a chat history, displaying both user inputs and model responses.
          Real-time Response: The application uses streaming to display the model's response in real-time, allowing for a more interactive and engaging experience.
